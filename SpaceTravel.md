# Space Travel

## Proposed by Ethan Hu, Sonja Larson, Catherine Liu

**Stage 1:** Proposal


A slow paced game in which the player drifts through space and sees different sightes of planets and stars. The player can move up and down in a 2D display, dodging plantes as they float. 

Platformer side view of space which would have a 2D array with planets, stars, etc that move through the array. Graphics would be used to display a player within the 2D space and then they would be able to control the player moving through the space and dodging/moving around the planet objects on screen.

There would be classes for a player as well as the other objects within space that would be put into a main class that would have the code for the 2D array. Input from the user would control the move the player thorough the 2D view of space. 

This program would use graphics as well as user input moving through the given array.
