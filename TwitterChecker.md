# Quite Okay Image Format Decompiler

**Stage 1:**  Proposal

A proposal for a project requires at least three students,
with at least one student from each block!  (This will require
you to utilize GitHub and learn about branches, commits, and pulls.)
The proposal must address each of the following:

- [ ] This program will be able to take any a username using “@” and then if it is real and public (if it isn’t then it will print out either “user does not exist” or “this account is not public”) and be able to print out how many tweets they have, their bio, their last tweet (with the time they tweeted it) etc. Then, whenever they tweet something they the program will update and print out their new tweet with “New Tweet!” without needing to call it. 
- [ ] A main class, the twitter class (that will be the one accessing Twitter)
- [ ] The new Java that this will be used in this is program is accessing twitter and using the data from the to create methods. 
- [ ] Figuring out the code to access twitter and make it actually work will take up the majority of the time and people. Besides that, another person would focus on how you would input a username into Twitter and figure out if the person is private or doesn’t exist as well as accurately find people who are public and make the person found here work with the code accessing twitter. Lastly making all the simpler methods, formatting what is printed out and everything else needed will be more than enough for three people.
