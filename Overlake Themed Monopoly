Overlake Themed Monopoly 

This code would require two people each block (or more). The code would have multiple classes: chance cards, players, each place on the board (with 
subclasses - action, go to jail, free parking, paycheck, etc.), houses and hotels. Board is an array, with each player having instance variables 
relating to each action. The game itself would host four players and would be overlake themed. Player wins when everyone else goes bankrupt. 
There is also a special attack: steal, which allows you to try to rob from other players bank with an 85% of losing.
