Overlake Themed Monopoly 

This code would require two people each block (or more). The code would have multiple classes: chance cards, players, each place on the board (with 
subclasses - action, go to jail, free parking, paycheck, etc.), houses and hotels. Board is an array, with each player having instance variables 
relating to each action. The game itself would host four players and would be overlake themed. Player wins when everyone else goes bankrupt. 
There is also a special attack: steal, which allows you to try to rob from other players bank with an 85% of losing. 

~Edit~ the new java part of it could be graphics and figure out how to make a basic board-looking thing on the screen as well as some character objects to keep track of the
character on screen
