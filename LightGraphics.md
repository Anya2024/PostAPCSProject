# Light Graphics
test
**Stage 1:**  Proposal

A proposal for a project requires at least three students,
with at least one student from each block!  (This will require
you to utilize GitHub and learn about branches, commits, and pulls.)
The proposal must address each of the following:

- [ ] The project will focus on creating light graphics, showing how the light will reflect off of different objects like mirrors and other reflective items compared to how it will hit non-reflective objects and how the light will spread out to illuminate a certain area. I want to create an environment where random objects will be created and have a light beam shoot a light beam in a constant direction and have it accurately simulate how the light would spread through the environment among the random objects. 
- [ ] I believe I will have a light beam class and a random things class that contains both reflective and non-reflective objects. The light beam class will have methods that change how the light beam will act depending on whether they hit the reflective or non reflective objects. I think that I may also have a class that creates a lamp post and a light bulb (not the light beam however). The main method will be in it's own tester class that creates a new environment and sends out a light beam from the lamp post. 
- [ ] I will use rudimentary graphics to display how the lamp post will move.
- [ ] I believe the division of work will be, all of us working on the light class as it will contain the most complicated methods. One person working on the graphics of the lamp post class, while another person will make the random objects class and programm how the objects will randomly be placed. The last person would work on how to code the main tester class to create a new environment.
